============
This project contains an implementation for I2C to work with the raspberry pi and beaglebone black
and Adafruit's BMP180 sensor as well as Adafruit's OLED using the SSD1306 chip. I plan to add
support for more items as I get my hands on them.

This is always a work in progress so check back for updates. As always, software is provided
"as is" and I assume no responsibility.
