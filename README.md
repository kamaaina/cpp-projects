cpp-projects
============
This project contains an implementation for I2C to work with the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black.
Currently supported products are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1603">Adafruit BMP180</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/938">Adafruit 128x64 OLED</a></li>
</ul><br><br>
I plan to add support for more items as I get my hands on them.
<br>
This is always a work in progress so check back for updates. As always, software is provided
"as is" and I assume no responsibility.
